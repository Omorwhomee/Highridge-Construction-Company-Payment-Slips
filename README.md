## Questions

## The program should accomplish the following tasks:

Use variables to create a list of workers dynamically (at least 400 workers).
Utilize a for loop to generate payment slips for each of the 400 workers.
Implement the following conditional statements within the for loop:
If the salary is greater than $10,000 and less than $20,000, assign the Employee level as "A1."
If the salary is greater than $7,500 and less than $30,000 and the employee is female, set the Employee level as "A5-F."
Add exception handling to your Python code to address potential errors.
Convert your Python code into R.
Package your code into a zipped file and include a README file for submission. Share the zipped file or a link to your GitHub repository.
